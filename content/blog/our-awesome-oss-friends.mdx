The open-source software (OSS) community thrives on collaboration and mutual support. Developers contribute their time and expertise to build incredible products that anyone can use for free.

Most OSS tools start as indie labs of love, crafted on nights and weekends without funding or resources. Gaining users and contributors is an uphill battle when you’re running a project solo in your spare time. Discovery and sustainability remain ongoing challenges. How do these unsupported tools get discovered? How can we support the developers behind them?

Here OSS Friends comes into the picture.

## What is OSS Friends

OSS Friends is a community of open-source creators who link out to other OSS projects from their websites and GitHub repo. By featuring other open-source tools and repos on an “OSS Friends” page, we can send some link juice their way. This helps various projects get discovered while supporting the broader OSS ecosystem.

[Formbricks kickstarted OSS Friends](https://formbricks.com/clhys1p9r001cpr0hu65rwh17) to advocate for awesome OSS products and startups.

## How it all started for Firecamp?

In August, [Formbricks tweeted, calling all the OSS founders to join the friends page](https://x.com/shreya_gr/status/1692203339268903194?s=20), and I asked them to join for Firecamp. But back then, Firecamp had ~100 Github stars, and to join the OSS Friends page, 200 stars were required.

**I quickly decided to grow the Firecamp repo to 200 stars, and [we did it](https://twitter.com/burcs/status/1696693410168496595?s=2).**

## How we integrate OSS Friends on the Firecamp website?

Well, this is going to be a challenge as we were super busy with Firecamp application development. So, I decided to [create an issue](https://github.com/firecamp-dev/website/issues/7) and see if any contributors are open to work.

Within a day, [Rohit](https://twitter.com/rohitmo62534745) picked up and created the Firecamp OSS Friends page.
